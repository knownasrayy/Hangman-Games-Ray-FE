# Hangman‑Games‑Ray‑FE

A simple Hangman (“tebak kata”) word‑guessing game built with modern web technologies (TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Vite). This is a frontend-only application — all game logic runs in the browser, ready to deploy as a static site.

## 🧠 About The Project

The Hangman game is a classic — the player tries to guess a hidden word by selecting letters, without exceeding a limited number of wrong guesses.  
This project brings that experience to the web using React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite, making it lightweight, responsive, and easy to deploy.  

It’s perfect as a coding‑exercise, portfolio project, or as a base to expand (e.g. add backend, high‑score saving, multiplayer, etc).
